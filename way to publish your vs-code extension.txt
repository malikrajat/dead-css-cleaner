Option 1: Install the extension manually (Recommended)
	Open VS Code
	Go to Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X)
	Click the "..." menu â†’ "Install from VSIX..."
	Select your unused-css-detector-0.0.1.vsix file
	Reload VS Code
Option 2: Change the publisher name
	If you want to publish to the marketplace later, you'll need a valid publisher. Update your package.json:

	Accepted edits to

	package.json


Option 3: Create a publisher account
	To publish to the marketplace:

	Go to https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage
	Create a publisher account
	Use that publisher name in your package.json
	Run vsce publish to publish
	Option 4: For development, use F5 to run
	The easiest way for development:

	Open this project in VS Code
	Press F5 to run the extension in a new Extension Development Host window
	This bypasses the marketplace entirely
	The 404 error happens because VS Code tries to check for updates from the marketplace, but your extension isn't published there yet. Installing locally or running in development mode will solve this.
